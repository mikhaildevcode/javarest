# Java REST API Demo

This repository contains a simple Spring Boot application that exposes CRUD
operations for an `Employee` entity. It uses an in-memory H2 database and can
be used as a starting point for building RESTful services in Java.

## Running the application

The project is built with Maven:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080/api/employees`.
